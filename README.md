Payloads for buffer overflows and other cyberweapons, often large amounts of effort are involved in reducing the size of the payload. Sub 30 bytes is a personal record for a local /bin/sh. All these payloads are used in house, they arent just toy demonstrations. If need-be we can and will hand modify to get around antivirus, often without the need for more advanced techniques (packers etc).
